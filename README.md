## About Me
I am a Computer Science graduate at California Polytechnic University, Pomona, with a strong passion for data analysis and uncovering insights that drive informed decision-making. I enjoy working with data to solve real-world problems and have developed projects that highlight my analytical thinking and technical skills. I'm always eager to dive into large datasets, find meaningful patterns, and communicate results through clear visualizations and reports. Feel free to check out my repositories to see some of the projects Iâ€™ve contributed to!
